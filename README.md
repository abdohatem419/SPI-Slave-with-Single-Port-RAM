# SPI-Slave-with-Single-Port-RAM
This project involves a SPI-based interface with a RAM module and its associated testbench. The SPI_Wrapper module integrates a SPI slave and RAM, enabling data storage and retrieval through SPI commands. The testbench validates RAM operations by simulating SPI transactions to write and read data, checking for correct functionality.
